## Quick Start

### Real-time Video Transformation

Realtime connections are LiveKit-backed in the SDK. Existing client usage stays the same: provide a
camera `MediaStream`, choose a realtime model, and handle the transformed remote stream.

```typescript
import { createDecartClient, models } from "@decartai/sdk";

const model = models.realtime("lucy-restyle-2");

// Get user's camera stream
const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
  audio: true,
  video: { 
		frameRate: model.fps,
		width: model.width,
		height: model.height,
  }
});

// Create a client
const client = createDecartClient({
  apiKey: "your-api-key-here"
});

// Connect and transform the video stream
const realtimeClient = await client.realtime.connect(stream, {
  model,
  onRemoteStream: (transformedStream) => {
    videoElement.srcObject = transformedStream;
  },
  initialState: {
    prompt: {
      text: "Anime",
      enhance: true
    }
  }
});

// Change the style on the fly
realtimeClient.setPrompt("Cyberpunk city");

// Disconnect when done
realtimeClient.disconnect();
```

#### Front-camera mirroring

Pre-flip the input stream:

```ts
const realtimeClient = await client.realtime.connect(stream, {
  model,
  mirror: "auto", // or true to always mirror
  // ...
});
```

Options:
- `false` (default) — never mirror.
- `"auto"` — mirror when the input track reports `facingMode: "user"` (mobile front cameras).
- `true` — always mirror (e.g. desktop webcams).

#### Fast mode

Fast mode (`speed: "fast"`) serves the session from a higher-compute tier for lower latency and higher throughput; output quality is unchanged. It is currently available for `lucy-2.5` / `lucy-latest` and `lucy-vton-3.5` / `lucy-vton-latest`, in the US region only, and is billed at 2x the standard realtime rate for those models. Other models ignore the option. Omit it (the default) for standard mode.

```ts
const realtimeClient = await client.realtime.connect(stream, {
  model: models.realtime("lucy-2.5"),
  speed: "fast",
  // ...
});
```

Models that offer fast mode list it in their definition's `supportedSpeeds`:

```ts
models.realtime("lucy-2.5").supportedSpeeds; // ["fast"]
models.realtime("lucy-2.1").supportedSpeeds; // undefined
```

Passing `speed` for a model without the capability logs a warning through the client's logger and the session runs at standard speed.

### Watch a Stream

A connected realtime session exposes an SDK `subscribeToken` once it reaches a
connected state. Share that SDK token with viewers — `client.realtime.subscribe`
uses it to request receive-only LiveKit credentials from Decart, then connects to
the LiveKit room for the styled output stream. No viewer camera is required.
Browser-produced streams can include LiveKit frame metadata for glass-to-glass
latency, so viewers also need a browser runtime that can create the SDK's
frame-metadata worker; unsupported runtimes reject those tokens before joining.

> **Viewers must be on this SDK version or newer.** A browser publisher now
> advertises frame timing by default, which makes the server append a packet
> trailer to every frame in the room. Viewers on an older `@decartai/sdk`
> ignore the token's `frame_timing` flag and join without a strip worker — they
> connect successfully but decode nothing, so the video element stays black with
> no error raised. React Native viewers cannot strip trailers at all and are
> rejected with `UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORM_FEATURE`. Upgrade viewers before upgrading
> publishers.

**Producer** — capture the token from the active session:

```typescript
const realtimeClient = await client.realtime.connect(stream, {
  model,
  onRemoteStream: (transformedStream) => {
    videoElement.srcObject = transformedStream;
  },
});

realtimeClient.on("connectionChange", (state) => {
  if ((state === "connected" || state === "generating") && realtimeClient.subscribeToken) {
    const subscribeToken = realtimeClient.subscribeToken;
    // Pass `subscribeToken` to the viewer snippet below.
  }
});
```

**Viewer** — attach to the producer's stream with the token:

```typescript
import { createDecartClient, type RealTimeSubscribeClient } from "@decartai/sdk";

const client = createDecartClient({ apiKey: "your-api-key-here" });

const subscriber: RealTimeSubscribeClient = await client.realtime.subscribe({
  token: subscribeToken,
  onRemoteStream: (stream) => {
    videoElement.srcObject = stream;
  },
});

subscriber.on("connectionChange", (state) => {
  console.log(`Viewer state: ${state}`);
});

// Disconnect when done
subscriber.disconnect();
```

### Connection quality

There are two layers: a **preflight** check before connecting, and an **in-session** quality
signal while connected. Both report on a shared `"good" | "fair" | "poor" | "critical"` scale —
the SDK reports, you decide what to do (gate the UI, warn the user, etc.).

**Preflight (before connecting).** A fast, network-only reachability check — it spins up a
throwaway peer connection against public STUN, so there's no session and no cost:

```typescript
const { quality, metrics, reasons } = await client.realtime.checkConnectivity();
// metrics: { transport: "udp" | "relay" | "failed", rttMs }
if (quality === "critical") showFallbackUI(reasons);
```

**In-session quality.** While connected, the SDK derives a smoothed verdict from WebRTC stats
(latency, packet loss, bandwidth headroom, frame rate) and tells you which dimension is the
bottleneck:

```typescript
const realtimeClient = await client.realtime.connect(stream, {
  model,
  onRemoteStream: (s) => { videoElement.srcObject = s; },
  onConnectionQuality: ({ quality, limitingFactor, metrics }) => {
    // limitingFactor: "bandwidth" | "latency" | "loss" | "stall" | "cpu" | "none"
    // metrics: { rttMs, fps, packetLoss, upstreamJitterMs, availableUpstreamKbps, ... }
    console.log(quality, limitingFactor);
  },
});

// also available as an event and a getter:
realtimeClient.on("connectionQuality", (report) => { /* ... */ });
realtimeClient.getConnectionQuality(); // latest report, or null before the first sample
```

> `onConnectionQuality` and the `connectionQuality` event are **debounced** — they only re-fire
> when the verdict (`quality`/`limitingFactor`) changes, so they're not a live metrics feed. For a
> continuous read of the raw numbers, updated every stats tick (~1/s), use the `stats` event or
> poll `getConnectionQuality()?.metrics`:
>
> ```typescript
> realtimeClient.on("stats", (s) => updateLatencyHud(s.glassToGlass?.medianMs, s.video?.framesPerSecond));
> // or, on your own interval:
> setInterval(() => console.log(realtimeClient.getConnectionQuality()?.metrics.g2gMs), 1000);
> ```

**Glass-to-glass latency.** Network RTT hides the dominant cost in real-time video — model
inference — so a session can read "good" while actually feeling laggy. In browser sessions, the SDK
automatically attaches a capture timestamp using LiveKit frame metadata when the required worker is
available; the server propagates it through inference and the SDK matches it to output playout.
This surfaces **startup** (`ttffMs`) and **steady-state** (`g2gMs`) latency. When present,
glass-to-glass drives the latency verdict instead of RTT.

> Frame metadata is currently experimental in LiveKit and requires encoded-transform support.
> It does not alter visible pixels. `g2gDropRatio` remains `null` until frame IDs are propagated
> through the server pipeline as well as timestamps.

```typescript
const realtimeClient = await client.realtime.connect(stream, {
  model,
});

// g2g updates every stats tick — read it from the `stats` event (the
// `connectionQuality` verdict is debounced and would go stale between changes):
realtimeClient.on("stats", ({ glassToGlass }) => {
  console.log(glassToGlass?.ttffMs, glassToGlass?.medianMs);
});
```

For a *measured* verdict before connecting (instead of the network-only check), use the **deep
probe**: it briefly opens a real session with a synthetic source, measures glass-to-glass, then
tears it down. It requires a `model` and costs a short GPU session:

```typescript
const probe = await client.realtime.checkConnectivity({ deep: true, model });
console.log(probe.quality, probe.metrics.g2gMs, probe.metrics.ttffMs);
```

### Async Processing (Queue API)

For video generation jobs, use the queue API to submit jobs and poll for results:

```typescript
import { createDecartClient, models } from "@decartai/sdk";

const client = createDecartClient({
  apiKey: "your-api-key-here"
});

// Submit and poll automatically
const result = await client.queue.submitAndPoll({
  model: models.video("lucy-pro-v2v"),
  prompt: "Make it look like a watercolor painting",
  data: videoFile,
  onStatusChange: (job) => {
    console.log(`Status: ${job.status}`);
  }
});

if (result.status === "completed") {
  videoElement.src = URL.createObjectURL(result.data);
} else {
  console.error("Job failed:", result.error);
}
```

Or manage the polling manually:

```typescript
// Submit the job
const job = await client.queue.submit({
  model: models.video("lucy-pro-v2v"),
  prompt: "Make it look like a watercolor painting",
  data: videoFile
});
console.log(`Job ID: ${job.job_id}`);

// Poll for status
const status = await client.queue.status(job.job_id);
console.log(`Status: ${status.status}`);

// Get result when completed
if (status.status === "completed") {
  const blob = await client.queue.result(job.job_id);
  videoElement.src = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
}
```

### Client Tokens

Mint short-lived client tokens on your server instead of shipping your API key.
The response also carries a signed JWT (`token`) that any server or edge runtime
can verify **offline** against the platform's public JWKS — no API key, no
round-trip to Decart:

```ts
import { createDecartClient, verifyClientToken, decodeClientToken } from "@decartai/sdk";

const client = createDecartClient({ apiKey: process.env.DECART_API_KEY });
const { apiKey, token } = await client.tokens.create({ expiresIn: 300, metadata: { service_tier: 0 } });

// Verify offline (EdDSA signature, exp, iss, aud) and read the claims
const claims = await verifyClientToken(token); // or client.tokens.verify(token)
claims.serviceTier; // 0
claims.pool; // "free" for tier 0, otherwise "paid"
// also: userId, organizationId, apiKeyName, apiKeyId, allowedModels, allowedOrigins,
// expiresAt, realtimeConcurrentSessionLimit, zeroDataRetention, attribution, raw

// Read claims WITHOUT verifying — no network, no crypto. Untrusted: display/logging only.
const untrusted = decodeClientToken(token);
```

The JWKS comes from `https://platform.decart.ai/api/auth/jwks` (the platform
host, not `baseUrl`) and is cached; the JWT library is loaded lazily so bundles
that never verify do not ship it. Errors: `TOKEN_INVALID`, `TOKEN_EXPIRED`,
`TOKEN_VERIFY_ERROR` (JWKS unreachable). Options: `{ jwksUrl, issuer, audience,
clockTolerance }`. This is an offline check, not an API call. It needs WebCrypto: on
runtimes without it (React Native) `verify` rejects with `UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORM_FEATURE`;
`decodeClientToken` works everywhere.

### React Native / Expo

React Native realtime requires [LiveKit's React Native packages](https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-react-native)
and an early `registerGlobals()` call. Plain `react-native-webrtc` is not
supported. SDK imports and `createDecartClient(...)` usage stay the same.

```sh
npm install @decartai/sdk livekit-client@2.20.1 \
  @livekit/react-native@2.11.1 \
  @livekit/react-native-webrtc@144.1.1
```

Call LiveKit setup from a side-effect module that runs before your router or app
entrypoint:

```ts
// livekit-bootstrap.ts
import { registerGlobals } from "@livekit/react-native";

registerGlobals();
```

```ts
// index.ts
import "./livekit-bootstrap";
import "expo-router/entry"; // or import your root App component
```

With the globals registered, realtime usage is the same as on the web. Use the
model's numeric FPS when configuring native camera capture, then pass that
`MediaStream` to the SDK:

```ts
import { createDecartClient, models, resolveFpsNumber } from "@decartai/sdk";
import { mediaDevices } from "@livekit/react-native-webrtc";

const client = createDecartClient({ apiKey: "your-api-key-here" });
const model = models.realtime("lucy-2.5");
const captureFps = resolveFpsNumber(model.fps);

const cameraStream = await mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
  audio: false,
  video: {
    facingMode: "user",
    frameRate: captureFps,
    width: model.width,
    height: model.height,
  },
});

const realtimeClient = await client.realtime.connect(cameraStream, {
  model,
  preferredVideoCodec: "vp8",
  onRemoteStream,
});
```

For Expo, install the config plugins:

```sh
npm install @livekit/react-native-expo-plugin@1.0.2 \
  @config-plugins/react-native-webrtc
```

Add them to `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      "@livekit/react-native-expo-plugin",
      "@config-plugins/react-native-webrtc"
    ]
  }
}
```

Run `npx expo prebuild` and rebuild the native app. LiveKit does not run in Expo
Go. Bare React Native apps must follow LiveKit's native setup instructions.

Outgoing `mirror` and deep connectivity preflight are browser-only and fail with
`UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORM_FEATURE` on React Native. Mirror the local preview with your
native video view instead.
